				Watch this video to learn more about my BMW E39 rebuild. 
				I’ve tackled everything from suspension and
				performance modifications to interior reupholstery and audio design,
				learning valuable skills in both automotive design and project management. This
				passion project not only allowed me to deepen my technical expertise but also my 
				ability to take on larger-scale workscopes, structure progress, and ensure completion—
				all the while maintaining attention to detail and adapting to unforeseen challenges. 
				This video aims to illustrate my passion for hands-on problem-solving and continuous
				learning through the restoration of an iconic vehicle.
